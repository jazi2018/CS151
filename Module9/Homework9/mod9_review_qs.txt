5. The three file stream data types are  ______ ,  ______ , and  ______  .
        - fstream, ifstream, ofstream

15. If a file fails to open, the file stream object will be set to  ______  .
        - false (failbit is set)

39.
    1. Initialize an int called byte_ctr
    2. Create an fstream object and open for ios::in and ios::binary
    3. While not at end of file (!file.eof()):
            a. Get character from stream
            b. Iterate byte_ctr
    4. Return byte_ctr

40.
    1. Create two fstream objects, both opened to ios::in and ios::binary
    2. Compare file sizes
        a. Use seekg(0, ios::end) on both files
        b. Check if file1.tellg() == file2.tellg()
        c. If they are NOT equal, return false (the files are different sizes and therefore
           not identical)
    3. Use seekg(0, ios::beg) and clear() on both files
    4. Iterate through the file by bytes (while !file1.eof() && !file2.eof()):
        a. if file1.get() == file2.get(), continue
        b. otherwise, return false
    5. If entire loop is completed, return true

41.
    1. Open source file for ios::in | ios::binary
    2. Open destination file for ios::out | ios::binary
    3. use seekg(0, ios::end) on source file object
    4. While not source file .fail():
        a. Set a char variable to sourcefile.peek()
        b. Write the char varaible to destination file with .write()
        c. Move character pointer back one by using seekg(-1L, ios::cur)
