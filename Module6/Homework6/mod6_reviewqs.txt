        - Bird & operator=(const Bird &original);

26. Assume a class named  Yen  exists.  Write the header for a member function that overloads the  <  operator for that class.
        - bool operator<(const Yen &right) const;

28. Assume a class named  Team  exists which contains a sequence of  Player  objects.  Write the header for a member function that 
    overloads the square brackets  [  ]  operator for that class which returns a single  Player  as a specified position in the sequence.
        - Player & operator[](int index);
