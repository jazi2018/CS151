2. A member function of a class that is not completely implemented (only the
   function header is provided) so that all concrete descendant classes must
   implement that function is called a(n) ______ function.
        - abstract / pure virtual

8. A base class pointer needs to be ______  to be assigned to a derived class pointer.
        - downcast

11. If every  C1  class object can be used as a  C2  class object, the relationship
    between the two classes should be implemented using  ______
        - inheritance

13. The keyword  ______  prevents a member function from being overridden in a descandant
    class.
        - final

14. To have the compiler check that a member function in a child overrides a virtual
    member function in the parent, you should use the keyword  ______  after the function
    declaration in the child class.
        - override

15. Will the statement:
    Animal a;
    compile? If not, why not?
        - No. Animal is an abstract class, so objects of it cannot be instantiated.

16. Will the statement:
    pAnimal = new Cat;
    compile? If not, why not?
        - Yes

17. Will the statement:
    pCreature = new Dog ;
    compile? If not, why not?
        - Yes

18. Will the statement:
    pCat = new Animal ;
    compile? If not, why not?
        - No. Firstly, Animal is an abstract class and could not be instantiated.
          Second, a pointer to a derived class cannot point to the base class.
