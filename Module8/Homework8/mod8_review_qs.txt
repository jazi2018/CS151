1. A(n)  ______  is represented in memory as an array of characters with a null terminator.
        - C-string

2. The  ______  header is required before the library of C-string functions can be used in a program.
        - <cstring>

3. A(n)  ______  is written in your program as a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes.
        - string

4. The type  ______  is used by the compiler as the type of a string literal.
        - const char* (const char pointer)

15. The  ______  function returns the value of a string converted to an integer.
        - stoi()

18. The  ______  function converts an integer to a string.
        - to_string()

19. Write a function whose prototype is: char lastChar(const char *str) and which takes a non-empty
    C-string as a parameter and returns the last character in the string. For example, the expression
    lastChar("abc") would return the character 'c'. Do not use a string or any functions in the string class.
        - char lastChar(const char *str)
          {
            int len = strlen(str);
            //return dereferenced pointer (char) to last character
            return *(str + (len - 1));
          }
